# Download sources

There are several download sources created by the community. All known sources are gathered in the [Hydra Library](https://moyasee.github.io/HydraLibrary/library.html).

::: info Only sources with `Trusted` or `Safe to use` status will be covered. It is **highly recommended** that you only use sources with these statuses.
:::

This topic will present and explain their main differences:

## Formats

Different sources make their games available in different formats. Here is an explanation of each of them:

### Repack:

`Repack` is a term used for a **compressed** version of the game. Games from sources that make `repacks` available will come with an **installer** (setup.exe), which you need to run to install the game.

`DODI`, `FitGirl`, `GOG`, `KaOsKrew`, `Tiny-Repacks`, `Empress` and `ByXatab` (when **it has** `repack` in the title) are sources that provide `repacks`.

::: info After installing them, you can delete the installer files to save storage.
:::

### Pre-installed:

`Pre-installed` is a term used for pre-installed games, only requiring their extraction.

`Online-Fix`, `SteamRip`, `AtopGames`, `Kazumi`, `Shisuy's source` and `Repack-Games` are sources that provide `pre-installed` games.

::: info You must have [`WinRAR`](https://www.win-rar.com/fileadmin/winrar-versions/winrar/winrar-x64-711br.exe) installed on your computer to extract these files. (If Hydra did not already extract them automatically)
:::

### Portable:

`Portable` is a term used for `pre-installed` games, **without the need for extraction**.

`ByXatab` games (when **they don't have** `repack` in the title), `Kazumi` games downloaded via `torrent`, and some `RuTracker` games, are `portable` games, without the need for extraction.

## Available languages

Sizewise, for considerably small games, all sources will support all languages.

For bigger games, with multiple voiceovers, the sources may or may not support all languages:

- Games from `ByXatab` in its `portable`, `DODI`, `FitGirl`, `GOG` and `Online-Fix` options, for the most part, support **all official languages** of the game.

- Games from `ByXatab` in its `repacks`, `SteamRip`, `AtopGames`, `Shisuy's source`, `Repack-Games`, `KaOsKrew`, `Tiny-Repacks` and `Empress` only support **English and Russian**.

- Games from `Kazumi` and `RuTracker` will vary according to the download option.

## Online

Games from the `Online-Fix` source have a crack that enables online multiplayer via Steam, in the vast majority of cases, and via Epic Games/Xbox, in certain cases.

Games from other sources that have `Coop`, `Multiplayer` or `Online` in the title will come with the `Online-Fix` crack pre-applied, or optional.

::: info In the case of multiplayer via Steam, it is only possible to play with people who are also playing via `Online-Fix`.
:::

::: tip If the game has multiplayer via LAN (Local Area Network), it is possible to play with anyone using any source (even the original game), as long as everyone is on the same version.
:::

::: warning If the game is not updated, the online may not work properly

## Downloaders

`Torrent` is the most common form of download among all sources. It works in the peer to peer (p2p) method, seeds and peers are required for downloads to work. Because of this dependency, its speed tends to be the most inconsistent among all the options available on Hydra. However, it is still possible to achieve high speeds for games with a high number of seeds and peers.

`Gofile`/`Pixeldrain`/`Datanodes`/`Mediafire`/`Qiwi` are free hosters for direct downloads, without relying on seeds and peers. Because they are free, their speeds may still not be as consistent. Among them, `Gofile` presents better and more consistent results.

`Real-Debrid`/`Torbox` are paid debrid services, useful for downloading games faster and more consistently. Of both options, `Real-Debrid` is the best, although more expensive. You can check their prices on the official websites of [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) and [Torbox](https://torbox.app/)

`Nimbus` is Hydra's own debrid service, which is still in beta, occasionally enabled for Hydra Cloud subscribers.

## DLCs/Additional Content

Usually, all sources distribute all additional content that games have. Unfortunately, the only way to know exactly what content comes in each option is by checking the official website of each source.

::: info In games from the `GOG` source, the DLCs have their own setups. So, in addition to installing the base game, you need to install the DLCs, if you want.
:::

## Which sources should I use?

Based on all the points discussed in this topic, here are some recommendations of sources to use when downloading a game on Hydra Launcher:

### For offline games:

- `ByXatab`, in its [portable](download-sources.html#portable) options;
- `DODI`;
- `SteamRip`;
- `Kazumi`.

### For online games:
- `Online-Fix`;
- Any other source that has `Coop`, `Multiplayer` or `Online` in the title.

::: tip It is recommended to choose the most updated version among these options.

Despite all their differences, and your personal preferences, it is recommended to add all sources with `Trusted` or `Safe to use` status. Some games are only available from a specific source.
