# How to apply Fix-Repair

`Fix-Repair` is a compressed file with all the **crack** files of the game, which is found in `Online-Fix` games, **for emergency purposes only**.

::: warning It is not necessary to apply it to play the game. You should only apply it when your antivirus has deleted some **crack** file and you were unable to restore it.

In this case, you must first [add an exclusion to the game folder](add-exclusion.md), and **only then** apply `Fix-Repair`.

Here's a guide on how to do this:

## Open the `Fix-Repair` folder:
