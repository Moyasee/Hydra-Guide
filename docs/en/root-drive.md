# How to move the game folder to the root of your disk

The `root` is the point where the file structure begins. It is the **highest possible level** folder, where all the files from a location are present **inside** it.

The `drive` is your storage unit, it is represented by unique letters, such as `C:`, which is usually the drive where your Windows is installed.

An example to represent what the `root` of your `drive` is:

```md
C: <--- Root of your drive
├─ Program Files
├─ Program Files (x86)
│ └─ DODI-Repacks
├─ Users
│ └─ <Your user>
└─ Windows
...
```

Here's how to move your folder to the root of your drive:

::: info In this guide, `C:` will be used, but this guide applies to any other `drive` you may have.

## Locating your game folder

Navigate to your game folder, and click on the folder before it, so that you can move it:

![Click on the previous folder](/en/assets/guides/previous-folder.png)

![Game folder](/en/assets/guides/folder-to-move.png)

::: tip For `Online-Fix` games, it is interesting to move not only the game folder itself, but also the folder containing `Fix-Repair`, for organization purposes.

## Move the folder to the root of your disk

Now, just click on the game folder, hold down the left mouse button, and move it to the `root` of your `C:` drive:

![Selected game folder](/en/assets/guides/selected-folder.png)

![Game folder being moved](/en/assets/guides/moving-folder-to-root.png)

After that, your game will be present in the `root` of your chosen `drive`.
