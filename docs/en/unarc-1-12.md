# ISDone.dll - An error occurred while unpacking! Unarc.dll returned an error code: -1/-12

![Unarc.dll error code: -1](assets/errors/unarc-1.png)
![Unarc.dll error code: -12](assets/errors/unarc-12.png)

These errors may be caused by a missing version of Visual C++ on your computer. Therefore, install the [common redistributables](common-redistributables.md).

Additionally, it is recommended to create a folder to install your games, [add an exclusion](add-exclusion.md) to it, and select it in the setup:

![Exclusion](assets/errors/unarc-1-12-exclusion.png)

![Installation directory](assets/errors/unarc-1-12-installation-directory.png)

After that, start the installation again.

::: tip If it is a FitGirl game, also activate the RAM memory limiter at the beginning of the installation setup:

:::

If the error persists, install the game from another source that makes its games available in a [pre-installed](download-sources.html#pre-installed) or [portable](download-sources.html#portable) format.
