# How to restore files in Windows Defender

Sometimes, essential files from game **cracks** are quarantined in `Windows Defender`, and you need to restore them in order to open and play the game.

::: info These files are modified files to bypass the game's digital protection (DRM). Because of this, antiviruses can assign a generic virus identification to these files, even though they are not. This is called a `false positive`. 
:::

Here is a guide on how to restore a file in `Windows Defender`:

## Open the Start menu and search for `Virus and threat protection`:

## Click on `Protection history`:

::: warning If you use another antivirus, the `Protection history` option will not appear in this tab, but rather the antivirus that you have installed on your computer. In this case, you will need to open it and `restore` the file inside it.

This guide only covers `Windows Defender`, each antivirus has a different interface.

## Select the `Quarantined` Threat in question:
