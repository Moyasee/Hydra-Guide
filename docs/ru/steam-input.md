# How to add a game to Steam and enable Steam Input

Steam has a compatibility layer for generic controls called `Steam Input`, which is capable of translating the controls' commands into something that the game can often recognize, if it doesn't already recognize them natively.

::: tip If you already have the game's executable selected in Hydra, you can add it to Steam by clicking `Manage` on your page > `Create Steam shortcut`:

If you have Steam open, you need to exit it for the changes to be displayed.

This way, it will be inside Steam with all its banners, icons and images already pre-applied. This is especially useful if you use a portable device, or use Steam's `Big Picture` mode.
