![Unarc.dll error code: -6](assets/errors/unarc-6.png)

This error may be caused by a missing version of Visual C++ on your computer. Therefore, install the [common redistributables](common-redistributables.md).

Also, [move the setup folder to the root of your disk](root-drive.md), and select to install the game on the root of your disk as well:

![Installation Directory on Disk Root](assets/errors/unarc-6-root.png)

After that, start the installation again.

::: tip If it is a FitGirl game, also activate the RAM memory limiter at the beginning of the installation setup:

:::

If the error persists, install the game from another source that makes its games available in a [pre-installed](download-sources.html#pre-installed) or [portable](download-sources.html#portable) format.
